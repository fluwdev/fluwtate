description: Learn how to integrate asynchronous state persistence into your store using `createAsyncPersistenceMiddleware`.
---

The **Async Persistence Middleware** enables you to persist your application's state asynchronously using browser storage that supports `Promise`-based operations, such as IndexedDB or cloud storage. This is useful when you need to interact with storage systems that handle asynchronous data saving and loading.

## Setting Up Async Persistence Middleware

To integrate asynchronous persistence into your store, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the Store

First, create your store with the initial state. You can also load the persisted state from an asynchronous storage system (e.g., `IndexedDB`, `localStorage`):

```typescript
import { createStore } from "fluwtate";
import { loadAsyncPersistedState } from "fluwtate";

// Load the persisted state asynchronously
const initialState = await loadAsyncPersistedState({
  key: "myAppState",
  storage: localStorage,  // Or a custom async storage
}) || { user: null, todos: [] };

// Create the store
const store = createStore(initialState);
```

### Step 2: Add the Async Persistence Middleware

Add the Async Persistence Middleware to your store to automatically persist the state asynchronously:

```typescript
import { createAsyncPersistenceMiddleware } from "fluwtate";

// Apply the async persistence middleware
store.use(createAsyncPersistenceMiddleware({
  key: "myAppState",
  storage: localStorage,  // Or a custom async storage
}));
```

### Step 3: Customizing the Async Persistence
You can customize the behavior of async persistence by modifying the serializer, deserializer, or storage options.

**Using Custom Async Storage**
If you have a custom asynchronous storage system (e.g., IndexedDB, a cloud service), you can pass it into the middleware:

```typescript
store.use(createAsyncPersistenceMiddleware({
  key: "myAppState",
  storage: myCustomAsyncStorage,  // Use a custom async storage
}));
```

## Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to set up asynchronous persistence:

```ts
import { createStore,createAsyncPersistenceMiddleware,loadAsyncPersistedState } from "fluwtate";

// Load the persisted state asynchronously
const initialState = await loadAsyncPersistedState({
  key: "myAppState",
  storage: localStorage,  // Or a custom async storage
}) || { user: null, todos: [] };

// Create the store
const store = createStore(initialState);

// Apply the async persistence middleware
store.use(createAsyncPersistenceMiddleware({
  key: "myAppState",
  storage: localStorage,  // Or a custom async storage
}));
```
This setup ensures that your state is saved asynchronously and will persist across page reloads.

The `devtool` middleware allows you to integrate your state store with [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools). This enables you to inspect, debug, and manage your application's state directly from the browser's developer tools, making development much easier.

---

### Usage

To use the `devtool` middleware, simply call the `devtool` function and add it to your store using the `use` method.

### Example

```ts
import { createStore } from "fluwtate";
import { devtool } from "fluwtate";

const store = createStore({
  user: null,
  todos: [],
});

store.use(devtool("MyCustomStore"));
```

In this example, we are integrating Redux DevTools with the store, giving it the name "MyCustomStore". You can replace "MyCustomStore" with any custom name for your application.

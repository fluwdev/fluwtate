## **What is this library?**

This library is a lightweight, modular state management solution designed for applications ranging from simple projects to complex enterprise-level systems. It offers a highly customizable API, seamless React integration, and robust TypeScript support, ensuring both flexibility and performance.

The library emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and efficiency, making it an excellent alternative to popular state management tools like Zustand or Redux.

## **Key Features**

- **Core API**: Powerful methods for managing and updating global states.
- **Modular State**: Easily split and manage your state into reusable modules using `createModule`.
- **Middleware Support**: Extend the library's functionality with custom middlewares like persistence or logging.
- **React Integration**: Optimized `useStore` hook for efficient state consumption in React components.
- **TypeScript-Friendly**: Fully typed API for enhanced developer experience and better tooling support.
- **Shallow Comparison**: Minimizes unnecessary React re-renders, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to scale and adapt to your project's needs.

## **Why Use This Library?**

This library bridges the gap between simplicity and robustness. It allows developers to create intuitive global state systems while maintaining control over state performance and modularity. Whether you're building a small app or a complex multi-feature project, the library is designed to adapt and grow with your needs.

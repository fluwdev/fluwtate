description: Creating and managing a store with support for asynchronous initial state, transactions, and persistence.
---

The `createStore` function is used to create a state store, allowing you to manage the state of your application. It can handle both synchronous and asynchronous initial state, making it flexible and suitable for various use cases, such as loading state from an API or other asynchronous operations. Additionally, it now supports transactions and state persistence.

## Usage

To create a store, simply call the `createStore` function with the initial state. If the initial state is a function, it will be treated as an asynchronous operation and resolved before setting the state.

### Example

```ts
import { createStore } from "fluwtate";

const initialState = {
  user: null,
  todos: [],
};

const store = createStore(initialState);
```

## Asynchronous Store

If the initial state is a function, it will be treated as an asynchronous operation and resolved before setting the state.

```ts
import { createStore } from "fluwtate";

const initialState = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/initial-state");
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};

const store = createStore(initialState);
```

In the asynchronous example, the `initialState` function fetches user data asynchronously before resolving the initial state for the store.

## Parameters

- `initialState`: The initial state for the store. It can be:
  - A synchronous value representing the initial state (e.g., an object, array, etc.).
  - A function returning a Promise that resolves to the initial state (useful for async operations like fetching data).

## Methods

### `getState()`

Returns the current state of the store.

```ts
const state = store.getState();
```

### `setState(updater)`

Updates the state of the store using the provided updater function. Supports transactions for batching multiple state updates.

```ts
store.setState((state) => ({
  todos: [...state.todos, newTodo],
}));

// Inside a transaction:
store.transaction(() => {
  store.setState((state) => ({ ...state, user: { name: "Alice" } }));
  store.setState((state) => ({
    ...state,
    todos: [...state.todos, { id: 1, title: "Learn Fluwtate" }],
  }));
});
```

### `subscribe(listener)`

Subscribes to state changes in the store and executes the provided listener function. Listeners will only be triggered once after a transaction is completed.

```ts
store.subscribe((state) => {
  console.log("State changed:", state);
});
```

### `use(middleware)`

Adds a middleware to the store. Middleware is a function that intercepts state changes and can perform additional actions, such as logging, validation, or persistence. Middleware integrates seamlessly with transactions and persistence.

```ts
const middleware = (prevState, nextState) => {
  console.log("State changed:", prevState, nextState);
  return true;
};
store.use(middleware);
```

### `persist(options)`

Enables persistence for the store, allowing state to be saved and restored automatically.

```ts
store.persist({
  key: "app-state",
  storage: localStorage, // or sessionStorage
});
```

### `transaction(callback)`

Begins a transaction, buffering state updates until the transaction is complete. This reduces unnecessary re-renders and listener notifications.

```ts
store.transaction(() => {
  store.setState((state) => ({ ...state, user: { name: "Alice" } }));
  store.setState((state) => ({
    ...state,
    todos: [...state.todos, { id: 1, title: "Learn Fluwtate" }],
  }));
});
```

## Key Features

- Handles both synchronous and asynchronous initial state.
- Provides a simple API for managing state changes.
- Supports middleware for intercepting state changes and performing additional actions.
- Offers transactions for batching state updates.
- Enables state persistence with integration to storage solutions.
- Flexible and extensible architecture for building complex state management solutions.

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Persistence and Transactions

You can combine the persistence and transaction features to optimize your application's state handling.

```ts
store.persist({
  key: "app-state",
  storage: localStorage,
});

store.transaction(() => {
  store.setState((state) => ({ ...state, user: { name: "Bob" } }));
  store.setState((state) => ({
    ...state,
    todos: [{ id: 2, title: "Persist State" }],
  }));
});
```

### Middleware with Transactions

Middleware will only be executed once after a transaction completes, ensuring consistent behavior.

```ts
const loggingMiddleware = (prevState, nextState) => {
  console.log("Logging state change:", prevState, nextState);
  return true;
};
store.use(loggingMiddleware);

store.transaction(() => {
  store.setState((state) => ({ ...state, user: { name: "Charlie" } }));
  store.setState((state) => ({
    ...state,
    todos: [{ id: 3, title: "Test Middleware" }],
  }));
});
```
